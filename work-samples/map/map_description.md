### Map of Power Plants Operated by the Calpine Corporation

This is a map of the Geysers Geothermal Area in California, highlighting the geothermal powerplants.   These power plants are located on the worlds largest geothermal field, with a nominal capacity of 1442.4 MW!  The area, which never contained any actual geysers, was formed 1.3 Ma years ago as a large body of silica rich magma forced its way up thought the fault in the Coastal Range of CA.  The 45-square-mile area contains hot springs that were known and used by the six bands of indigenous tribes:  three band of the Pomo, two of the Wappo, and a band of the Lake Miwok.  The first geothermal plant was installed in 1921 to power a nearby resort.  Today, Calpine, Bottle Rock Power, and the Northern California Power Agency operate 19 geothermal power plants, with Calpine operating the majority in terms of number (16) and power output (1442 MW). The polygons below show the location of these power plants  and their operators currently in operation.

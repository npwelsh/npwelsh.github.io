I am an energy professional interested in renewable generation, decarbonizing our day to day activities, energy markets, geothermal for heating and cooling as well as electricity generation, and zero emission transportation. This portfolio showcases the work I have done, a blog I update to showcase and practice my energy analyst work, and shares a bit more about my interests and work experiences.

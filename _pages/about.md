## About Me
Hi! My name is Nolan Welsh.  I am currently a Master's Student in Renewable Energy at CU Boulder. I am using my ten years of experience in geology and field engineering to renewable energy! Excited about emerging decarbonization technologies, new trends in power transmission and generation, geothermal for power generation as well heating and cooling, zero-carbon buildings and transportation, and solutions to make the energy transition work for everyone.

In my free time, I enjoy getting on my bike, poking around somewhere new backcountry skiing, or tinkering around with some new project at home. Always excited about learning new things!

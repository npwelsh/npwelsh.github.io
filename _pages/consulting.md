In addition to my day job, I also do some consulting on the side, for energy, non-profit, and geology clients

Here are some example of work of consulting work I have done, either as a team or individually:

### Investigation of Philippines Enhanced Geothermal Systems
Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) represent the next evolution in geothermal technology. ACEN Renewable was interested how this could apply to the Philippines, already a global leader in geothermal energy.  I used my background in geological and renewable energy systems to conduct a literature review on the viability of EGS in the country.  Using GIS, I highlighted areas most favorable for development  In addition I made recommendations on what near term and far term steps they should take to further pursue EGS development. 

### HOMER Software Output Analyzer 

In conjunction with Earthspark, me and a team of four other developed a tool to find what size of solar and battery microgrids would be the most cost effective and reliable to support electric cooking loads in Haiti.  To do this, the goal was to take the outputs from the HOMER Software models to evaluate the
reliability indexes for each run to compare them against each other. A python script was developed that took homer annual hourly energy profiles (8760 files) and outputted  metics includes number of hours with capacity shortage, the number of hours battery capacity is below 30%, the System Average Interruption Duration Index in number of hours of outage in a year, the System Average Interruption Frequency Index in number of distinct outages per year, and total number of days with outages.  It also produces a file with a summary of each of those outages, both as a spreadsheet and a heat map.  The script was complied into and executable for easy distribution 

See the script on github [here.](https://github.com/npwelsh/8760-Load-Analysis)

### Investigation for Energy Storage Opportunities in PJM

Three other students and as summer consultants for Peregrine Energy Solutions analyzed areas in the PJM Power Market where an energy storage project would be the most feasible. Out team looked at state and local policies, nodal price values, environmental considerations, and interconnection queues, amongst others, to rank and find the most favorable spots.  Our work found 30 parcels, equivalent to over 3GW, in PJM that had enough value for Peregrine to proceed with development.

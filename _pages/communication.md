Here are examples of my communication skills in writing, speaking, and visualization.  They are deliverables for my Communicating for Sustainability and Impact class for my masters program.  This class challenged me to get out of my comfort zone and express my work and interests in a clear, concise manner. It better prepared me to communicate complex and expansive topics to a wide variety of audience in a defined scope. 


## Personal Narrative  

This is a writing sample about my relationship with climate change, and how I came to the field of renewable energy. It gives a little more detail about myself, and is designed to be the written answer of "tell me about yourself".

## Infographic

This deliverable was designed to showcase my ability to effectively deliver information visually. A lot of information must be conveyed quickly, so that a large audience can understand it.  I chose to explain Enhanced Geothermal Systems, how they differ from conventional geothermal, and what role they play in decarbonization.

## Blog Post 

Here I was required to take a complex topic and distill it down in a fun and accessible way for a wide audience.  I used it an opportunity to showcase my data science skills as well.  I enjoyed this so much, I started using it as a template for blog posts on my website, to practice both my communication and data skills.

## Lightning Talk

The lightning talk challenges the speaker to convey a complex topic in 5 mins or less.  For my topic, I challenged the assumption that fossil fuels will be needed to industrialize emerging economies.

## About Me
Hi! My name is Nolan Welsh.  I am currently a Master's Student in Renewable Energy at CU Boulder. I am using my ten years of experience in geology and field engineering to renewable energy! Excited about emerging decarbonization technologies, new trends in power transmission and generation, geothermal for power generation as well heating and cooling, zero-carbon buildings and transportation, and solutions to make the energy transition work for everyone.

In my free time, I enjoy getting on my bike, poking around somewhere new backcountry skiing, or tinkering around with some new project at home. Always excited about learning new things!

## Energy Analyst Work

### California Batteries 

This is post exploring  the growth of utility scale batteries in California, and how they are flattening the duck curve.  This was done for my science communication class.

### HOMER Software Output Analyzer  

This project was done as a final for my Microgrids class in conjunction with Earthspark  and is currently ongoing. The goal was to take the outputs from the HOMER Software models to evaluate the
reliability indexes for each run to compare them against each other.  By comparing the metrics from each run, we are aiming to find what size of solar and battery microgrid would be the most cost
effective and reliable to support electric cooking loads in Haiti.

### Opportunities for Energy Storage in PJM

As part as my internship for Peregrine Energy Solutions, we analyzed areas in PJM were an energy storage project would be the most feasible. We looked at state and local policies, nodal price values, environmental considerations, and interconnection queues, amongst others, to rank and find the most favorable spots.  Our work found 30 parcels, equivalent to over 3GW, in PJM that had enough value for Peregrine to proceed with development on.

Hi!  I’m Nolan. I am a professional with experience in geoscience and engineering interested in applying that knowledge to finding sustainable energy solutions .  I love learning how things work and why. In my free time, I enjoy getting on my bike, poking around somewhere new backcountry skiing, or tinkering around with some new project at home.   I am currently feeding my curiosity by pursuing a Masters in Renewable Energy at CU Boulder. I am particularly excited about how data science can be used to guide more effective energy choices.  My career has always been driven by two goals: challenging myself and leaving the world a better place than I found it.

I wasn’t always interested in energy. But I have  always been interested in the natural world around me, and how humans interact with it.  I grew up taking long road trips across the west, often to visit family. I would be  glued to my window to see the landscapes we   traversed through, taking note of the human infrastructure scattered through them , be that mines, power plants, bridges, airports, etc. This interest led me to a geological engineering undergraduate degree and a career working for mining, environmental, energy, and water industries.

As my career progressed, however, I noticed more problems affecting lives around me. Problems related to climate change began to creep in.   Places I had travelled to growing up were  devastated by fires or floods or both.  Friends and family started to become displaced by natural disasters .  While I still found my work important, I felt like it was not having a direct impact on what I was seeing.  At the same time, I saw solutions becoming more and more viable.  I began to wonder if I could have more impact doing something else. 

My friends started working in renewable and sustainable fields, bringing expertise from a vast variety of backgrounds.  They encouraged me to follow suit, and I started to brainstorm how I could take my experience from a geological career and apply it towards the transition to non-carbon energy.  I have always loved how data can provide a more complete answers to complex questions.  I also worked with data in my previous career and found though conversations with friends , a similar need for processing skills in renewable energy.  So I decided to finally take the leap and pursue this interest by enrolling in a master in renewable energy.  I look forward to seeing what direction this new path takes me!
